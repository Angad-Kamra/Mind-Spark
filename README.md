## üìö About This Project

Hi! I'm Angad Kamra, a student developer passionate about combining technology with mental health support. MindSpark is my attempt to create a web platform that could help individuals with ADHD through personalized gaming therapy and cognitive assessment. As I'm learning to code, I combined my interest in psychology with web development to create this project. While I'm still learning programming, I used AI tools to help me understand and implement complex features, making this both a learning experience and a meaningful project.
