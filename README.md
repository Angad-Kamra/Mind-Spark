## üìö About This Project

Hi! I'm Angad Kamra, a student developer passionate about combining technology with mental health support. MindSpark is my attempt to create a web platform that could help individuals with ADHD through personalized gaming therapy and cognitive assessment. As I'm learning to code, I combined my interest in psychology with web development to create this project. While I'm still learning programming, I used AI tools to help me understand and implement complex features, making this both a learning experience and a meaningful project.

The project is currently live and being used by real users, which has been an amazing learning experience in terms of understanding user needs and improving the platform based on feedback.
